# shoppy_store
This Flutter app connects to a RESTful API and allows users to browse a list of products, add them to their shopping cart or wishlist, and remove them as needed. The app provides a seamless, interactive experience for managing product selections.

### Features
Product List Display: Fetches a list of products from a public API (fakestoreapi.com).
Product Details: Displays detailed information for each product, including title, price, and image.
Cart & Wishlist Management: Users can add products to their cart or wishlist, view the current items in both sections, and remove items.
Dynamic Updates: The app dynamically updates the UI when products are added or removed from the cart or wishlist.
Navigation: Easy navigation between the home screen, cart, and wishlist screens.
# challenge overcome
1.Used ListView.builder to efficiently display the list of products dynamically fetched from the API.
2.Ensured that each product can be added either to the cart or wishlist based on user interaction.
